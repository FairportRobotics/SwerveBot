## Features

- Swerves
- Drives

## Notes

- Requires single Logitech F310 controller at port 0
- Left joystick is forward, backwards and strafe

## Needs Work

- [PDP cannot see the canbus](http://www.ctr-electronics.com/downloads/pdf/PDP%20User's%20Guide.pdf)
- The wheels seem to get off of zero pretty often.
- Don't rotate all the way around on 1000 -> 0
- How to set everything up when initializing (i.e. 0 is forward? on init, where are the wheels?)
- Put encoders on the drive wheels (for motion profiling)
- Field oriented vs human oriented drive
- Understand the encoder settings a little better
- Do the reverse motor instead of rotating the wheel fancy trick
- Get more shuffleboard items displayed.
- Tank is just power to left and right with 0 heading.

- Make field oriented work
