# R&#179;'s First Swervebot

## Features

- Swerves
- Drives

## Notes

- Requires single Logitech F310 controller at port 0
- Left joystick is forward, backwards and strafe
- Right joystick is cc/ccw rotation (? Field Oriented ?)

## Needs Work

- Back right rotation encoder is not working (bad connection?)
- Encoder seems not that accurate (i.e. adjusting with power level jumps in value)
- How to set everything up when initializing (i.e. 0 is forward? on init, where are the wheels?)
- Field oriented vs human oriented drive
- Understand the encoder settings a little better
- Original code for angle -> enc pos seemed more complex
